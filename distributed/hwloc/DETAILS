cat << EOF
The Portable Hardware Locality (hwloc) software package provides a portable abstraction (across OS,
versions, architectures, ...) of the hierarchical topology of modern architectures, including NUMA
memory nodes, sockets, shared caches, cores and simultaneous multithreading. 
It also gathers various system attributes such as cache and memory information as well as the locality
of I/O devices such as network interfaces, InfiniBand HCAs or GPUs. It primarily aims at helping
applications with gathering information about modern computing hardware so as to exploit it accordingly
and efficiently.
