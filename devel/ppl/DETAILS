cat << EOF
The Parma Polyhedra Library (PPL) provides numerical abstractions
especially targeted at applications in the field of analysis and
verification of complex systems. These abstractions include convex
polyhedra, defined as the intersection of a finite number of (open
or closed) halfspaces, each described by a linear inequality (strict
or non-strict) with rational coefficients; some special classes of
polyhedra shapes that offer interesting complexity/precision tradeoffs;
and grids which represent regularly spaced points that satisfy a set of
linear congruence relations. The library also supports finite powersets
and products of (any kind of) polyhedra and grids and a mixed integer
linear programming problem solver using an exact-arithmetic version
of the simplex algorithm. (More details are available on the PPL's
internal mechanisms.)
