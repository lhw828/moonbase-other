NEdit is a Unix text editor for programmers and general users. It
combines a standard, easy-to-use, graphical user interface with the
thorough functionality and stability required by users who edit text
eight hours a day. It includes a macro language with a complete
library of editing functions, state-of-the-art syntax highlighting
for 30 common languages and text processors, and the best
mouse-interactivity available in a Unix text editor.
