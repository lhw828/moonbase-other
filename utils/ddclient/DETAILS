DDclient is a small but full-featured client requiring only Perl and
no additional modules. It runs under most UNIX OSes and has been
tested under GNU/Linux and FreeBSD. Supported features include:
operating as a daemon, manual and automatic updates, static and
dynamic updates, optimized updates for multiple addresses, MX,
wildcards, abuse avoidance, retrying failed updates, and sending the
update status to syslog and through e-mail.
