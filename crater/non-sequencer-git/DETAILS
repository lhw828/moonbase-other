The Non Sequencer is a powerful, lightweight, real-time,
pattern-based MIDI sequencer. It utilizes the JACK Audio
Connection Kit for MIDI I/O and the NTK GUI toolkit
for its user interface.

Everything in Non Sequencer happens on-line, in realtime.
Music can be composed live, while the transport is rolling.
