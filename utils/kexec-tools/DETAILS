cat << EOF
kexec is a set of systems call that allows you to load another kernel
from the currently executing Linux kernel.  The current implementation
has only been tested, and had the kinks worked out on x86, but the
generic code should work on any architecture.

Some machines have BIOSes that are either extremely slow to reboot,
or that cannot reliably perform a reboot.  In which case kexec may
be the only alternative to reboot in a reliable and timely manner.
