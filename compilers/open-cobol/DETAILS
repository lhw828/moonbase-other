OpenCOBOL is an open-source COBOL compiler. OpenCOBOL implements a substantial
part of the COBOL 85 and COBOL 2002 standards, as well as many extensions of
the existent COBOL compilers.

OpenCOBOL translates COBOL into C and compiles the translated code using the
native C compiler. You can build your COBOL programs on various platforms,
including Unix/Linux, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows.

The compiler is licensed under GNU General Public License.
The run-time library is licensed under GNU Lesser General Public License.
