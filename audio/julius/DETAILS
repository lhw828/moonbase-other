"Julius" is an open-source high-performance large vocabulary
continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) decoder software for
speech-related researchers and developers.  Based on word N-gram and
triphone context-dependent HMM, it can perform almost real-time
decoding on most current PCs with small amount of memory.
