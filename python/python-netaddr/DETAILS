cat << EOF
A network address manipulation library for Python.
Provides support for:

Layer 3 addresses
  IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, subnets, masks, prefixes
  iterating, slicing, sorting, summarizing and classifying IP networks
  dealing with various ranges formats (CIDR, arbitrary ranges and globs, nmap)
  set based operations (unions, intersections etc) over IP addresses and subnets
  parsing a large variety of different formats and notations
  looking up IANA IP block information
  generating DNS reverse lookups
  supernetting and subnetting

Layer 2 addresses
  representation and manipulation MAC addresses and EUI-64 identifiers
  looking up IEEE organisational information (OUI, IAB)
  generating derived IPv6 addresses.
