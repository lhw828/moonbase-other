cat << EOF
The library takes images in plain array format as input and converts them to a
multi-size representation.

Following is a list of features:

    * Easy to use and fully documented API
    * Supports color depths from 8 bits per channel to 64 bits per channel
    * Support for different color models: grayscale, RGB, CMY and their variants
       and even custom ones
    * Areas in the image can be marked for preservation or discard, or for
      additional seam rigidity
    * Once the image has been fully processed, the scaling can be done in
      real-time. In fact, the information can be saved and read out later
      without any further processing
    * The resizing is done with a single function which automatically performs
      all the necessary operations; it can also work in successive steps
      without wasting computational time
    * Possibility to tune the carving operation by letting the seams be less
      connected, or more rigid, or both (the rigidity can be modulated on a
      local basis)
    * Can export and import the visibility map (the seams)
    * Other images can be attached and undergo the same carving process as the
      parent image
    * The automatic feature detection algorithm can be tuned by selecting among
      different energy functions, and easily defining cusom ones
    * Reports progress through a customizable interface
    * A signalling system permits to handle errors cleanly
    * Portable to all major OS's
