cat << EOF
libdvbcsa is a free implementation of the DVB Common Scrambling Algorithm - DVB/CSA - with encryption and decryption capabilities.
Features

Portability. This library has been successfully tested on different processors with 32 bits, 64 bits and 128 bits word width,
little-endian and big-endian bytes ordering.

Performance. It comes in two flavors: a classical single packet implementation and a faster parallel bitslice implementation.
The parallel implementation can take advantages of MMX, SSE or Altivec instruction sets. Parallel implementation can process
Mpeg TS packets at 300Mbps or more on recent processors.

Freedom. libdvbcsa is released under the General Public License, ensuring it will stay free, and used only for free software products.

Simplicity. The API comes with only 5 functions for the single packet implementation, and 6 functions for the parallel bit-slice implementation.
