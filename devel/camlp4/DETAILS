Camlp4 is a software system for writing extensible parsers for programming
languages. It provides a set of OCaml libraries that are used to define
grammars as well as loadable syntax extensions of such grammars.
Camlp4 stands for Caml Preprocessor and Pretty-Printer and one of its most
important applications is the definition of domain-specific extensions of the
syntax of OCaml.
