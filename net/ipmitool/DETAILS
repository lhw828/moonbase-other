IPMItool is a utility for managing and configuring devices that
support the Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) version
1.5 and version 2.0 specifications. IPMI is an open standard for
monitoring, logging, recovery, inventory, and control of hardware
that is implemented independent of the main CPU, BIOS, and OS. The
service processor (or Baseboard Management Controller, BMC) is the
brain behind platform management and its primary purpose is to handle
the autonomous sensor monitoring and event logging features.
