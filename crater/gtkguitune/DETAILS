cat << EOF
Guitune is a linux program for tuning guitars
and other instruments by using the method of
Schmitt-triggering, i.e. counting the number of
triggerings between two trigger levels in a certain
amount of time.

Why not use FFT like many other tuning devices?
Because other tuning devices are not as fast as this!
