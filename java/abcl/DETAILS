           SHORT="Full implementation of the Common Lisp language in the JVM"

cat << EOF
Armed Bear Common Lisp (ABCL) is a full implementation of the Common Lisp
language featuring both an interpreter and a compiler, running in the JVM.
Originally started to be a scripting language for the J editor, it now
supports JSR-223 (Java scripting API): it can be a scripting engine in any
Java application. Additionally, it can be used to implement (parts of) the
application using Java to Lisp integration APIs.
