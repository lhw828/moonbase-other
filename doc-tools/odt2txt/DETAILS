odt2txt is a command-line tool which extracts the text out of
OpenDocument Texts produced by OpenOffice.org, StarOffice,
KOffice and others.

odt2txt can also extract text from some file formats similar
to OpenDocument Text, such as OpenOffice.org XML (*.sxw),
which was used by OpenOffice.org version 1.x and older
StarOffice versions. To a lesser extend, odt2txt may be useful
to extract content from OpenDocument spreadsheets (*.ods) and
OpenDocument presentations (*.odp).
