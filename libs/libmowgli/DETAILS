cat << EOF
mowgli is a development framework for C (like GLib), which provides
high-performance and highly flexible algorithms. It can be used as a
supplement to GLib (to add additional functions (dictionaries, hashes),
or replace some of the slow GLib list manipulation functions), or
stand-alone. It also provides a powerful hook system and convenient
logging for your code, as well as a high-performance block allocator.

mowgli builds upon previous attempts, such as libmisc, and will likely
become the primary development framework for most projects at Atheme.
