           SHORT="Extremely simple MTA to get mail off the system to a mailhub"

cat << EOF
A secure, effective and simple way of getting mail off a system to your mail hub.
It contains no suid-binaries or other dangerous things - no mail spool to poke
around in, and no daemons running in the background. Mail is simply forwarded to
the configured mailhost. Extremely easy configuration.

WARNING: the above is all it does; it does not receive mail, expand aliases or
manage a queue. That belongs on a mail hub with a system administrator.
