Quassel IRC is a modern, cross-platform, distributed IRC client,
meaning that one (or multiple) client(s) can attach to and detach from
a central core -- much like the popular combination of screen and
a text-based IRC client such as WeeChat, but graphical. In addition
to this unique feature, it aims to bring a pleasurable, comfortable
chatting experience, making communication with your peers not only
convenient, but also ubiquitous available.
