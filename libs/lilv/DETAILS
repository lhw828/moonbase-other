cat << EOF
Lilv is a C library (with Python bindings) for simple use of LV2 plugins in applications,
which includes utilities for investigating installed LV2 plugins.

Lilv is the successor to SLV2, rewritten to be significantly faster and have minimal dependencies.
It is stable, well-tested (the included test suite covers well over 90% of the code), and used by
many applications. Lilv is Free Software released under the extremely liberal ISC license. It depends
only on Serd and Sord, and is known to work on GNU/Linux, several BSD variants, Mac OS X, and Windows.
