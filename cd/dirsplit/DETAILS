displit is designed to for a simple purpose: convert a directory with many
multiple files (which are all smaller than a certain medium, eg. DVD) and
"splits" it into "volumes", looking for the optimal order to get the best
space/medium-number efficiency.
The actual action is either adding the files to mkisofs catalogs or real
moving of files into new directories (or creating links or symlinks).
The method is not limited to files, whole directories can also be handled
this way (see various filesystem exploration modes).
