gnuplot is a command-driven interactive function plotting program. It can be
used to plot functions and data points in both two- and three-dimensional plots
in many different formats, and will accommodate many of the needs of today's
scientists for graphic data representation. gnuplot is copyrighted, but freely
distributable; you don't have to pay for it.
