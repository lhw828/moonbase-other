cat << EOF
Finding the home country of a client using only the IP address can be
difficult. Looking up the domain name associated with that address can
provide some help, but many IP addresses are not reverse-mapped to any
useful domain, and the most common domain (.com) offers no help when
looking for the country.

This module comes bundled with a database of countries where various IP
addresses have been assigned. Although the country of assignment will
probably be the country associated with a large ISP rather than the
client herself, this is probably good enough for most log analysis
applications, and under tests has proved to be as accurate as
reverse-DNS and WHOIS lookup.
