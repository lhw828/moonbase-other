cat << EOF
If you've ever had to do this...

    eval "require $module";

to get around the bareword caveats on require(), this module is for you. It
creates a universal require() class method that will work with every Perl
module and its secure. So instead of doing some arcane eval() work, you can do
this:

    $module->require;

It doesn't save you much typing, but it'll make alot more sense to someone
who's not a ninth level Perl acolyte.
