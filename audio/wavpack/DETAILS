           SHORT="Audio compression formats"

cat << EOF
WavPack is a completely open audio compression format providing lossless,
high-quality lossy, and a unique hybrid compression mode.

In the default lossless mode WavPack acts just like a WinZip compressor for
audio files. However, unlike MP3 or WMA encoding which can affect the sound
quality, not a single bit of the original information is lost, so there's no
chance of degradation.

The hybrid mode provides all the advantages of lossless compression with an
additional bonus. Instead of creating a single file, this mode creates both a
relatively small, high-quality lossy file that can be used all by itself, and a
"correction" file that (when combined with the lossy file) provides full
lossless restoration.

WavPack employs only well known, public domain techniques (i.e., linear
prediction with LMS adaptation, Elias and Golomb codes) in its implementation.
Methods and algorithms that have ever been patented (e.g., arithmetic coding,
LZW compression) are specifically avoided.
