xine is a free video player which plays mpeg-2 and mpeg-1 video, DVDs
(unlocked/unencrypted only), video CDs, SVCDs, and AVI files (using
Win32 codecs) with synchronized audio and video, and optionally
fullscreen using the Xv extensions. This xine-lib offers VDPAU
hardware decoding and postprocessing.
