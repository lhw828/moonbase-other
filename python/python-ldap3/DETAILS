cat << EOF
LDAP operations look clumsy and hard-to-use because they reflect the old-age
idea that time-consuming operations should be performed client-side to not hog
the server with heavy elaborations. To alleviate this ldap3 includes a fully
functional Abstraction Layer that lets you interact with the LDAP server in a
modern and pythonic way. With the Abstraction Layer you don't need to directly
issue any LDAP operation at all.
ldap3 is a strictly RFC 4510 conforming LDAP V3 pure Python client library.
