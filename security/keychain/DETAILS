cat << EOF
Keychain helps you to manage SSH and GPG keys in a convenient and secure
manner. It acts as a frontend to ssh-agent and ssh-add, but allows you
to easily have one long running ssh-agent process per system, rather
than the norm of one ssh-agent per login session.

This dramatically reduces the number of times you need to enter your
passphrase. With keychain, you only need to enter a passphrase once
every time your local machine is rebooted. Keychain also makes it easy
for remote cron jobs to securely "hook in" to a long-running ssh-agent
process, allowing your scripts to take advantage of key-based logins.
