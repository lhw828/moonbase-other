Potrace(TM) is a tool for tracing a bitmap, which means, transforming a bitmap into a smooth, scalable image. The input
is a bitmap (PBM, PGM, PPM, or BMP format), and the output is one of several vector file formats. A typical use is to
create SVG or PDF files from scanned data, such as company or university logos, handwritten notes, etc. The resulting
image is not "jaggy" like a bitmap, but smooth. It can then be rendered at any resolution.

Potrace can currently produce the following output formats: SVG, PDF, EPS, PostScript, DXF, GeoJSON, PGM (for easy
antialiasing of pixel-based images), Gimppath, and XFig. Additional backends might be added in the future.

Mkbitmap is a program distributed with Potrace which can be used to pre-process the input for better tracing
behavior on greyscale and color images. See the mkbitmap examples page.
