Pinfo is an info file viewer. Pinfo is similar in use to lynx. It has
similar key movements, and gives similar intuition. You just move across
info nodes, and select links, follow them.

Pinfo also supports viewing of manual pages -- they're colorised like in
the midnight commander's viewer, and additionaly they are hypertextualized
(i.e. when pinfo encounters a reference of form manualname (n), then you
can press enter there, and voila -- you're on the page for 'manualname'.
