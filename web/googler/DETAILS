googler is a power tool to Google (Web & News) and Google Site Search
from the command-line. It shows the title, URL and abstract for each
result, which can be directly opened in a browser from the terminal.
Results are fetched in pages (with page navigation). Supports sequential
searches in a single googler instance.

googler was initially written to cater to headless servers without X.
You can integrate it with a text-based browser. However, it has grown
into a very handy and flexible utility that delivers much more. For example,
fetch any number of results or start anywhere, limit search by any duration,
define aliases to google search any number of websites, switch domains
easily... all of this in a very clean interface without ads or stray URLs.
The shell completion scripts make sure you don't need to remember any options.

googler isn't affiliated to Google in any way.
