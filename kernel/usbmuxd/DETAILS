cat << EOF
'usbmuxd' stands for "USB multiplexing daemon". This daemon is in charge of
multiplexing connections over USB to an iPhone or iPod touch. To users, it means
you can sync your music, contacts, photos, etc. over USB.

To developers, it means you can connect to any listening localhost socket on the
device. usbmuxd is not used for tethering data transfer, which uses a dedicated
USB interface as a virtual network device.

Multiple connections to different TCP ports can happen in parallel. An example
(and useful) tool called 'iproxy' is included that allows you to forward
localhost ports to the device---allows SSH over USB on jailbroken devices, or
allowing access the lockdown daemon (and then to all of the file access, sync,
notification and backup services running on the device).


Do things like this (from README);

  (Unplug + replug your jailbroken device)
  ./iproxy 2222 22 &
  ssh -p 2222 root@localhost
